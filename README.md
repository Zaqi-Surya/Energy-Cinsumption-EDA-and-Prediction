# Energy-Cinsumption-EDA-and-Prediction

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting energy consumption trends using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. By leveraging a data-driven approach, it aims to uncover patterns in energy usage, identify influencing factors, and build predictive models to estimate future consumption accurately. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering to enhance model performance and gain valuable insights into energy demand fluctuations.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to clean and explore energy consumption data, create insightful visualizations to support understanding, develop predictive models using relevant variables, and evaluate model performance using appropriate statistical metrics. By achieving these goals, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of energy usage dynamics and offer accurate forecasts for future consumption.

## Insights

Through the analysis, several key insights can be drawn. Energy consumption patterns tend to fluctuate based on temporal factors, including temperature variations and specific days of the week. Feature engineering plays a critical role in refining the accuracy of predictive models, and effective visualization techniques help detect anomalies and highlight important trends in the data. Understanding these insights allows for better energy management and optimization.

## Dependencies

## Advice

For optimal results, it is essential to work with a clean dataset that is free from missing values and anomalies. Conducting a thorough data exploration process before model development is crucial in identifying key trends and patterns. Applying feature engineering techniques can significantly improve predictive accuracy. Furthermore, evaluating the model with relevant metrics such as RMSE or MAE ensures robust and reliable forecasts.
